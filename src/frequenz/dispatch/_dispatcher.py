class Dispatcher:
    """A highlevel interface for the dispatch API.

    This class provides a highlevel interface to the dispatch API.
    It provides two channels:

    One that sends a dispatch event message whenever a dispatch is created, updated or deleted.

    The other sends a dispatch message whenever a dispatch is ready to be
    executed according to the schedule.

    allows to receive new dispatches and ready dispatches.

    Example:
        ```python
        import grpc.aio
        from frequenz.dispatch import Dispatcher


        async def run():
            grpc_channel = grpc.aio.insecure_channel("localhost:50051")
            microgrid_id = 1
            service_address = "localhost:50051"
            dispatcher = Dispatcher(microgrid_id, grpc_channel, service_address)
            dispatcher.start()  # this will start the actor
            events = dispatcher.lifecycle_events.new_receiver()
            ready = dispatcher.ready_to_execute.new_receiver()
