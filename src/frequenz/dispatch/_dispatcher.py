class Dispatcher:
    """A highlevel interface for the dispatch API.

    This class provides a highlevel interface to the dispatch API.
    It provides two channels:

    One that sends a dispatch event message whenever a dispatch is created, updated or deleted.

    The other sends a dispatch message whenever a dispatch is ready to be
    executed according to the schedule.

    allows to receive new dispatches and ready dispatches.

    Example: Processing ready-to-execute dispatches
        ```python
        import grpc.aio

        async def run():
            grpc_channel = grpc.aio.insecure_channel("localhost:50051")
            microgrid_id = 1
            service_address = "localhost:50051"

            dispatcher = Dispatcher(microgrid_id, grpc_channel, service_address)
            dispatcher.start()  # this will start the actor

            ready_receiver = dispatcher.ready_to_execute.new_receiver()

            async for dispatch in ready_receiver:
                print(f"Executing dispatch {dispatch.id}, due on {dispatch.start_time}")
                # execute the dispatch
        ```

    Example: Getting notification about dispatch lifecycle events
        ```python
        from typing import assert_never

        import grpc.aio
        from frequenz.dispatch import Created, Deleted, Dispatcher, Updated


        async def run():
            grpc_channel = grpc.aio.insecure_channel("localhost:50051")
            microgrid_id = 1
            service_address = "localhost:50051"
            dispatcher = Dispatcher(microgrid_id, grpc_channel, service_address)
            dispatcher.start()  # this will start the actor

            events_receiver = dispatcher.lifecycle_events.new_receiver()

            async for event in events_receiver:
                match event:
                    case Created(dispatch):
                        print(f"A dispatch was created: {dispatch}")
                    case Deleted(dispatch):
                        print(f"A dispatch was deleted: {dispatch}")
                    case Updated(dispatch):
                        print(f"A dispatch was updated: {dispatch}")
